# What is Datadog?

## Overview

Datadog is a monitoring and analytics platform for large-scale applications. It encompasses infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, log management, and user-experience monitoring. Datadog aggregates data across your entire stack with 400+ integrations for troubleshooting, alerting, and graphing. You can use it as a single source for troubleshooting, optimizing performance, and cross-team collaboration.

Datadog's offering in the Azure Marketplace enables you to manage Datadog in the Azure console as an integrated service. This availability means you can implement Datadog as a monitoring solution for your cloud workloads through a streamlined workflow. The workflow covers everything from procurement to configuration. The onboarding experience simplifies how you start monitoring the health and performance of your applications, whether they're based entirely in Azure or spread across hybrid or multi-cloud environments.

You provision the Datadog resources through a resource provider named `Microsoft.Datadog`. You can create, provision, and manage Datadog organization resources through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Datadog owns and runs the software as a service (SaaS) application including the organization and API keys.

## Capabilities

Integrating Datadog with Azure provides the following capabilities:

- **Integrated onboarding** - Datadog is an integrated service on Azure. You can provision Datadog and manage the integration through the Azure portal.
- **Unified billing** - Datadog costs are reported through Azure monthly bill.
- **Single sign-on to Datadog** - You don't need a separate authentication for the Datadog portal.
- **Log forwarder** - Enables automated forwarding of subscription activity and resource logs to Datadog.
- **Metrics collection** - Automatically send all Azure resource metrics to Datadog.
- **Datadog agent deployment** - Provides a unified management experience of Datadog agents. Install and uninstall Datadog agents as extensions on Virtual Machines and Azure App Services.

# QuickStart: Get started with Datadog by creating new instance

In this quickstart, you'll create a new instance of Datadog. You can either create a new Datadog organization or [link to an existing Datadog organization](link-to-existing-organization.md).


## Find offer

## Create a Datadog resource in Azure

The portal displays a selection asking whether you would like to create a Datadog organization or link Azure subscription to an existing Datadog organization.

If you are creating a new Datadog organization, select **Create** under the **Create a new Datadog organization**

:::image type="content" source="media/create/datadog-create-link-selection.png" alt-text="Create or link a Datadog organization" border="true":::

The portal displays a form for creating the Datadog resource.

:::image type="content" source="media/create/datadog-create-resource.png" alt-text="Create Datadog resource" border="true":::

Provide the following values.

|Property | Description
|:-----------|:-------- |
| Subscription | Select the Azure subscription you want to use for creating the Datadog resource. You must have owner access. |
| Resource group | Specify whether you want to create a new resource group or use an existing one. A [resource group](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md#resource-groups) is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. |
| Resource name | Specify a name for the Datadog resource. This name will be the name of the new Datadog organization, when creating a new Datadog organization. |
| Location | Select West US 2. Currently, West US 2 is the only supported region. |
| Pricing plan | When creating a new organization, select from the list of available Datadog plans. |
| Billing Term | Monthly. |

## Configure metrics and logs

Use Azure resource tags to configure which metrics and logs are sent to Datadog. You can include or exclude metrics and logs for specific resources.

Tag rules for sending **metrics** are:

- By default, metrics are collected for all resources, except virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and app service plans.
- Virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and app service plans with *Include* tags send metrics to Datadog.
- Virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and app service plans with *Exclude* tags don't send metrics to Datadog.
- If there's a conflict between inclusion and exclusion rules, exclusion takes priority

Tag rules for sending **logs** are:

- By default, logs are collected for all resources.
- Azure resources with *Include* tags send logs to Datadog.
- Azure resources with  *Exclude* tags don't send logs to Datadog.
- If there's a conflict between inclusion and exclusion rules, exclusion takes priority.

For example, the screenshot below shows a tag rule where only those virtual machines, virtual machine scale sets, and app service plans tagged as *Datadog = True* send metrics to Datadog.

There are two types of logs that can be emitted from Azure to Datadog.

1. **Subscription level logs** - Provide insight into the operations on your resources at the [control plane](../../azure-resource-manager/management/control-plane-and-data-plane.md). Updates on service health events are also included. Use the activity log to determine the what, who, and when for any write operations (PUT, POST, DELETE). There's a single activity log for each Azure subscription.

1. **Azure resource logs** - Provide insight into operations that were taken on an Azure resource at the [data plane](../../azure-resource-manager/management/control-plane-and-data-plane.md). For example, getting a secret from a Key Vault is a data plane operation. Or, making a request to a database is also a data plane operation. The content of resource logs varies by the Azure service and resource type.

To send subscription level logs to Datadog, select **Send subscription activity logs**. If this option is left unchecked, none of the subscription level logs are sent to Datadog.

To send Azure resource logs to Datadog, select **Send Azure resource logs for all defined resources**. The types of Azure resource logs are listed in [Azure Monitor Resource Log categories](../../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-categories.md).  To filter the set of Azure resources sending logs to Datadog, use Azure resource tags.

The logs sent to Datadog will be charged by Azure. For more information, see the [pricing of platform logs](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) sent to Azure Marketplace partners.

Once you have completed configuring metrics and logs, select **Next: Single sign-on**.

## Configure single sign-on

If your organization uses Azure Active Directory as its identity provider, you can establish single sign-on from the Azure portal to Datadog. If your organization uses a different identity provider or you don't want to establish single sign-on at this time, you can skip this section.

To establish single sign-on through Azure Active directory, select the checkbox for **Enable single sign-on through Azure Active Directory**.

The Azure portal retrieves the appropriate Datadog application from Azure Active Directory. The app matches the Enterprise app you provided in an earlier step.

Select the Datadog app name.

:::image type="content" source="media/create/sso.png" alt-text="Enable Single sign-on to Datadog." border="true":::

Select **Next: Tags**.

## Add custom tags

You can specify custom tags for the new Datadog resource. Provide name and value pairs for the tags to apply to the Datadog resource.

:::image type="content" source="media/create/tags.png" alt-text="Add custom tags for the Datadog resource." border="true":::

When you've finished adding tags, select **Next: Review+Create**.

## Review + Create Datadog resource

Review your selections and the terms of use. After validation completes, select **Create**.

:::image type="content" source="media/create/review-create.png" alt-text="Review and Create Datadog resource." border="true":::

Azure deploys the Datadog resource.

When the process completes, select **Go to Resource** to see the Datadog resource.
